# üç∑ Wine Quality Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This project aims to predict the quality of red wine by analyzing its chemical composition using a powerful machine learning technique‚ÄîArtificial Neural Networks (ANN). Red wine quality is influenced by various chemical properties, including alcohol content, acidity, pH, and more. By leveraging these features, our ANN model will classify wine quality, offering valuable insights into the factors that define a good wine.

## üß† Problem Statement

The primary objective of this case study is to predict the quality of wine based on a dataset containing several chemical characteristics. We will develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to accurately forecast the wine's quality score based on these features.

## üìä Dataset Overview

The dataset contains multiple parameters that describe the chemical composition of wine, including:
- **Fixed Acidity**
- **Volatile Acidity**
- **Citric Acid**
- **Residual Sugar**
- **Chlorides**
- **Free Sulfur Dioxide**
- **Total Sulfur Dioxide**
- **Density**
- **pH**
- **Sulphates**
- **Alcohol Content**
- **Wine Quality** (Target variable)

## üìå Project Outline

1. **Data Import**: Load the dataset and libraries (Pandas, NumPy) required for data manipulation.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values and perform basic cleaning.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gain insights into the dataset through visualization tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib to understand relationships between features.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Select and transform features to enhance model performance.
5. **Model Building**: Construct an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict wine quality.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using various metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python** üêç
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation

- **TensorFlow/Keras** for building the ANN model
- **Sklearn** for preprocessing and evaluation

## üöÄ Results and Insights

Our ANN model effectively predicts wine quality by learning patterns in its chemical composition. Through rigorous model evaluation and tuning, we aim to maximize prediction accuracy, providing meaningful insights into what makes a wine high or low quality.

## üí° Key Takeaways

- Wine quality is determined by complex interactions between its chemical properties.
